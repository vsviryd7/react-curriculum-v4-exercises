# Lesson-03 Component Lifecycle, Basic Hooks, State, and Props

For this exercise, you’ll begin working with state, props, and basic hooks and just as importantly, you’ll start learning how to debug React code like a real developer.

## Exercise: React Bug Hunt

You’ll be given **three small React components**, and each one contains a bug tied to lesson-03’s concepts:

- Bug #1 — Effect bug (lifecycle/logic issue)

- Bug #2 — Mutated State

- Bug #3 — Props Not Updating UI

Your job is to fix each bug and write a short explanation of what went wrong.

> **Important:** Each bug file already includes a commented  
> **"Explanation" section at the bottom of the component.**  
> Write your explanation inside that section after fixing the bug.

## Steps

1. In `src/exercises/lesson-03/` open the three bug files provided:
   - **BugEffectLoop.jsx** (Bug #1)
   - **BugMutatedState.jsx** (Bug #2)
   - **BugProps.jsx** (Bug #3)

2. Fix Bug #1 — Effect Issue
   - This component has a `useEffect` that runs on every `render`.
   - This component is meant to update a value when it first appears on the screen.
   - However, the current `effect` fires on **every** `render`, which causes the component to behave incorrectly.
   - Update the `effect` so that it only runs **once** when the component `mounts`.

- After fixing it, write your explanation in the **Explanation** section at the bottom of the file.

3. Fix Bug #2 — Mutated State
   - This component displays a `count` and updates it when the button is clicked.
   - There is an issue with how the `count` value is being changed.
   - Review how the `state` update is written and adjust it so React can properly detect the change and re-render the component.

- After fixing it, write your explanation in the **Explanation** section at the bottom of the file.

4. Fix Bug #3 — Props Not Updating
   - This component displays a `message` based on a `prop` and includes a button that attempts to change that message.
   - Right now, the `message` is stored in a way that React does not track, so the UI does not update when it changes.
   - Review how the `message` is being stored and updated. React only re-renders when values are managed through `state`, not regular variables.
   - Adjust the component so the `message` is stored in a way React can monitor, allowing the UI to update when the button is clicked.

- After fixing it, write your explanation in the **Explanation** section at the bottom of the file.

5. Open this file:  
   `src/exercises/lesson-03/studentWork.jsx`
   - Import your three bug components
   - Render them inside the `StudentWork` component so all three appear on the page

6. Test your fixes
   - Make sure the page loads without errors
   - Verify that each component now behaves as expected
   - Check the console to ensure no warnings appear

## Proof of Completion

Once all three bug components display and behave correctly in the browser:

1. Take a screenshot of your rendered page showing all three fixed components.
2. Save that image in the same directory where you’re working on your components:  
   `src/exercises/lesson-03/`
3. Commit and push your changes.
4. Submit your pull request (PR) link for review.

### Reminder

- React is already set up to render your work inside the <div id="root"></div> element in your app’s entry file.
- Make sure to reload the page and check the console for any remaining issues before submitting.
