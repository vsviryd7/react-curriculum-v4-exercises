# Lesson-08 Advanced Hooks: useCallback and useMemo, Optimizing a React App, and API-based Sort/Search 🎉

## Exercise Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Identify performance bottlenecks in React applications using render counters
- Apply `useMemo` to optimize expensive calculations and prevent unnecessary computations
- Apply `useCallback` to stabilize function references and prevent child component re-renders
- Understand when and why to use performance optimization hooks
- Measure the impact of optimization changes using visual performance indicators
- Debug React performance issues using console logs and render tracking

## Scenario Details

You're working on a **Professional Book Library Dashboard** for a company's internal learning platform. The application displays a collection of 100 professional development books with search, filtering, and statistics capabilities.

**The Problem:** The current implementation has significant performance issues! Every user interaction causes unnecessary re-renders and expensive recalculations, making the interface sluggish and inefficient.

**Your Mission:** Optimize the application using `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks to improve performance while maintaining all functionality. You'll use built-in render counters and **performance timing benchmarks** to measure your improvements.

**Current Features:**

- 📊 **Real-time Statistics**: Calculates averages, totals, and insights about the book collection with **artificial computational load** for benchmarking
- 🔍 **Search Functionality**: Filter books by title or author
- 🏷️ **Genre Filtering**: Multi-select genre filters with visual indicators
- 📈 **Dynamic Sorting**: Sort by title, author, rating, publication year, or price
- ❤️ **Favorites System**: Add books to personal favorites list
- 📱 **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in render counters positioned in the upper-right corner of components show optimization impact
- ⏱️ **Timing Benchmarks**: Real-time calculation timing displayed in microseconds to demonstrate performance improvements

## Instructions

### Step 1: Explore the Performance Issues

1. **Start the application** and navigate to the Lesson 08 page
2. **Observe the render counters** - notice how they appear in the upper-right corner of each component showing render counts
3. **Notice the timing benchmarks** - BookStats displays calculation time in milliseconds and microseconds
4. **Test these interactions** and watch both render numbers and timing:
   - Type in the search box (watch ALL components re-render)
   - Click different sorting options (notice expensive calculations)
   - Toggle genre filters (see unnecessary re-renders)
   - Click "Add to Favorites" on any book (watch BookCard components re-render)
   - **Pay special attention** to the BookStats timing display - you should see ~1-5ms calculation times

**Expected Issues:** You should see render counts rapidly increasing with every interaction, plus consistent calculation timing even when the underlying data hasn't changed.

### Step 2: Stabilize Search Handler Function (Priority: Immediate Impact)

**Location:** `StudentWork` (main component)  
**Problem:** `handleSearch` function is recreated on every render, causing all BookCard components to re-render.

**TODO #1:** Find the `handleSearch` function and stabilize it with `useCallback`.

**Why First:** This creates the most visible performance impact - every keystroke in search causes all BookCard components to unnecessarily re-render.

**Hints:**

- Look for the function that handles the search input onChange event
- Consider what dependencies `useCallback` needs (likely none)

**Test:** Type in the search box and verify that individual BookCard render counts don't increase unnecessarily.

### Step 3: Stabilize Favorites Handler Function (Priority: High Impact)

**Location:** `StudentWork` (main component)  
**Problem:** `handleToggleFavorite` function is recreated on every render, causing BookCard re-renders.

**TODO #2:** Find the `handleToggleFavorite` function and stabilize it with `useCallback`.

**Why Second:** This prevents cascading re-renders when managing favorites - currently clicking one favorite causes all BookCard components to re-render.

**Hints:**

- Look for the function that handles adding/removing favorites
- It takes a bookId parameter and toggles the book's favorite status
- Consider what dependencies `useCallback` needs (likely none)

**Test:** Click "Add to Favorites" and verify that other BookCard components don't re-render unnecessarily.

### Step 4: Optimize Expensive Sorting Operations

**Location:** `BookList` component  
**Problem:** The sorting operation runs on every render, even when the books or sortBy haven't changed.

**TODO #3:** Find the sorting logic and optimize it with `useMemo`.

**Why Third:** Once function references are stable, optimize the computational work.

**Hints:**

- Look for the `sortedBooks` variable assignment
- Consider what values should trigger a re-sort (books array, sort criteria)
- Make sure to include all necessary dependencies in the dependency array

**Test:** Change the sort option and verify that sorting only happens when `sortBy` changes, not on every render.

### Step 5: Optimize Expensive Statistics Calculations

**Location:** `BookStats` component  
**Problem:** Statistics calculations run on every render, even when the books array hasn't changed.

**TODO #4:** Find the `calculateStats()` function call and optimize it with `useMemo`.

**Why Last:** After fixing the render cascade issues, optimize the remaining expensive calculations.

**Performance Note:** The statistics calculations include artificial computational load (20,000 iterations of mathematical operations) to make performance improvements clearly visible through timing benchmarks. This simulates real-world expensive calculations like complex data processing or API transformations.

**Hints:**

- Look for where the statistics are being calculated in the component
- The calculation should only run when the `books` array changes
- Consider what should be in the dependency array
- **Watch the timing display** - you should see calculation time drop to nearly 0ms on subsequent renders when `books` hasn't changed

**Test:** After implementing, type in the search box and verify that:

- `BookStats` render count stays low when only search term changes
- **Timing benchmarks show ~0.00ms** for cached calculations vs. ~1-5ms for fresh calculations
- Console logs show "Stats calculation took: 0.0000ms" for memoized results

## Assessment Criteria

**Performance Improvements (Measure with Render Counters and Timing Benchmarks):**

- [ ] **BookStats calculation timing shows ~0.00ms for memoized results** (was ~1-5ms every render)
- [ ] BookList component renders only when books/sorting changes (was every keystroke)
- [ ] Individual BookCard components don't re-render when other BookCards are favorited
